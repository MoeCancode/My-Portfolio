# My-Portfolio

This webpage was created to introduce myself while showcasing my skills & projects to potential clients & employers.

The layout is simple to make navigation easy for all users and has been styled well to give it a clean look. This webpage itself is a project that helps sell me to the people that visit the page.

**HTML** and **CSS** are the only two languages used to create this single-page webpage. It has a responsive design that made use of flexbox to ensure that both, mobile & Desktop users, can have a nice experience on the webpage. However, it is recommended to view the webpage on a Desktop screen because of the several 'Hover' features that have been added to it. They make the user experience even more visually pleasing.

This is the what the layout of the website looks like on a Desktop screen

# Features

Here are a few features that were either added to make the website stand out or to add convenience in making changes in the future:

## Color variables

Only **four** colors were used to design the webpage and keep a nice-looking theme. They have been declared as **variables** so that the color theme can be changed if needed. For example, if we needed to create a lighter version of this webpage or if we wanted to replace the neon blue to pink to match our branding, it can be done with ease!

<br>

## Media queries

Media queries were set for several elements (in addition to flexbox) to ensure that both **mobile** and **Desktop** users can naviagate through the webpage easily. 

<br>

## Hover styling

For desktop users the webpage was made more interactive and attractive by adding styling changes to some elements on **hover**. These changes include sliding, glowing, enlarging and text boxes being revealed.

<br>

## Flexbox work section

The Work section is a collection of cards that follow the **flexbox display style**. This makes it really easy to Add or remove projects when you need to.
